> The fire had burned to coals and he lay looking up at the stars in their places and the hot belt of matter that ran the chord of the dark vault overhead and he put his hands on the ground at either side of him and pressed them against the earth and in that coldly burning canopy of black he slowly turned dead center to the world, all of it taut and trembling and moving enormous and alive under his hands.
-- All The Pretty Horses, p. 119

> They passed through a highland meadow carpeted with wild-Howers, acres of golden groundsel and zinnia and deep purple gentian and wild vines of blue morninglory and a vast plain of varied small blooms reaching onward like a gingham print to the farthest serried rimlands blue with haze and the adaman-tine ranges rising out of nothing like the backs of seabeasts in a devonian dawn.
-- Blood Meridian, p. 195

## William Zinsser

> Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society strangling in unnecessary words, circular >constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.

>Who can understand the clotted language of everyday American commerce:
the memo, the corporation report, the business letter, the notice from the bank
explaining its latest “simplified” statement? What member of an insurance or
medical plan can decipher the brochure explaining his costs and benefits? What
father or mother can put together a child’s toy from the instructions on the box?
Our national tendency is to inflate and thereby sound important. The airline pilot
who announces that he is presently anticipating experiencing considerable
precipitation wouldn’t think of saying it may rain. The sentence is too simple—
there must be something wrong with it.

But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest
components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be
a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that’s already in the
verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing
what—these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of
a sentence.
