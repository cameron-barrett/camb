This is our final project for UCSB's ECE153B Embedded Systems class! Right now this website is just a stub. More information and beautification to come soon!

## Update 3/3/23
Parts are shipping, due to arrive Monday/Tuesday next week. We ordered a Gikfun R385 pump kit including:
1 x DC Diaphragm Pump, 1 x 12V 1A Adaptor, 1m Water Tube, 2 x Black silica gel fixed ring, 1 x Fixed Board. We also ordered two 5V relays, and five Songhe capactive moisture sensors. We created a plan for assembly and picked up Poron foam for prototyping.

## Update 3/10/23
The parts arrived, and we are working to create test implementations of them on our dev board. The included DC power supply for the pump might be too powerful for our needs.
