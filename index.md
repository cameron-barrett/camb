## Overview

Perfect Pot is a plant pot with an integrated watering and monitoring system that will intelligently determine how much and how often to water your plants, saving you time and ensuring optimal plant health. Our system senses the moisture level in the soil and automatically adjusts the watering schedule to suit the needs of the plants. Perfect Pot also recirculates water as it drains, which not only saves water, but also helps to retain nutrients. You can keep tabs on your plants via wireless status updates, and the device will notify you when it runs out of water.
